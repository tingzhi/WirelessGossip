Maximum time to spread is correct.
But maximum hops should not always be 2, that is just wrong. Meaning there is a bug there.
For avgerage message per node, just calculate the data packets.

Simulation condition:
1Mbps
Turn on RTS/CTS
802.11b
Constant speed propagation delay model
Friis Propagation Loss Model
Non-Qos

For random node position allocator
deltaX: 5m
deltaY: 5m
GridWidth: sqrt(# of nodes)
row first
